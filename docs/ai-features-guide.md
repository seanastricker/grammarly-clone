  - Paragraphs
  - Outlines
  - Bullet points
  - Introductions
  - Conclusions
- **Tone selection**:
  - Professional
  - Casual
  - Academic
  - Creative
  - Persuasive

#### 3. **Analysis Tab**
- **Overall quality score** with visual indicators
- **Readability analysis** and scoring
- **Strengths identification** in current writing
- **Improvement suggestions** with actionable advice
- **Tone analysis** with consistency tracking

## Technical Implementation

### Core Service: `openai-service.ts`

```typescript
// Main functions
generateWritingSuggestions(text, userProfile, context)
generateContent(request, userProfile)
analyzeWriting(text, userProfile)
```

### Component Integration

The AI panel is integrated into the editor with:

- Toggle button in the header (Bot icon)
- Floating sidebar with smooth animations
- Real-time content analysis
- Direct content insertion capabilities

### User Experience

- **Smart suggestions** appear automatically as you write
- **One-click application** of AI suggestions
- **Seamless content generation** with customizable parameters
- **Non-intrusive interface** that doesn't interrupt writing flow

## Demo Mode vs Production

### Current Demo Implementation

For demonstration purposes, the service uses sophisticated mock data that:

- Simulates realistic AI responses
- Provides context-aware suggestions based on user type
- Includes proper delays to simulate API calls
- Generates meaningful content based on prompts

### Production Setup

To enable real OpenAI integration:

1. **Add your OpenAI API key** to environment variables:
   ```bash
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Uncomment the production code** in `openai-service.ts`

3. **Set up backend proxy** (recommended for security):
   - Move OpenAI calls to Firebase Cloud Functions
   - Remove `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true`
   - Implement proper API key protection

## User Type Customization

The AI adapts suggestions based on user profiles:

### Student Mode
- Focus on academic clarity and structure
- Emphasis on evidence-based arguments
- Suggestions for thesis statements and transitions

### Professional Mode
- Clear, confident communication
- Business-appropriate tone
- Action-oriented language

### Content Creator Mode
- Engagement and storytelling techniques
- Audience connection strategies
- Creative writing enhancements

### Author Mode
- Narrative flow improvements
- Character development suggestions
- Creative expression enhancements

## Usage Guide

### Activating AI Features

1. **Open any document** in the editor
2. **Click the Bot icon** in the header toolbar
3. **AI panel slides in** from the right side

### Getting AI Suggestions

1. **Start writing** - suggestions appear automatically
2. **Review suggestions** with confidence scores
3. **Click "Apply"** to accept suggestions
4. **Use the refresh button** to get new suggestions

### Generating Content

1. **Switch to "Generate" tab**
2. **Enter your prompt** describing what you need
3. **Select content type and tone**
4. **Choose length preference**
5. **Click "Generate Content"**
6. **Review and insert** generated content

### Analyzing Writing

1. **Switch to "Analysis" tab**
2. **View overall quality score** and breakdown
3. **Review strengths** and improvement areas
4. **Check tone analysis** for consistency
5. **Use suggestions** to enhance your writing

## Best Practices

### For Users

- **Write first, edit later** - let AI help with refinement
- **Experiment with different tones** for various audiences
- **Use content generation** for overcoming writer's block
- **Review AI suggestions critically** - they're tools, not rules

### For Developers

- **Rate limiting** - Implement proper API rate limiting
- **Error handling** - Graceful degradation when AI unavailable
- **User privacy** - Ensure content isn't stored by AI services
- **Performance** - Optimize API calls and caching

## Next Steps (Phase 5+)

- **Learning system** that adapts to user preferences
- **Collaborative AI** for team writing projects
- **Advanced analytics** with writing progress tracking
- **Custom AI prompts** for specialized writing needs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI panel not showing**
   - Check if Bot icon is active (purple when enabled)
   - Ensure user is authenticated

2. **Suggestions not generating**
   - Verify content length (minimum 10 characters)
   - Check console for API errors

3. **Slow performance**
   - AI calls are intentionally delayed in demo mode
   - Production will be faster with proper API setup

## Security Considerations

- API keys should never be exposed in client-side code
- Implement backend proxy for production
- Consider content privacy and data handling
- Use proper rate limiting and usage monitoring
