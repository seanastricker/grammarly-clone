## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Required for full functionality
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Firebase configuration (existing)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
# ... other Firebase config
```

### User Profile Integration

The AI assistant adapts its suggestions based on user profile:

```typescript
interface UserProfile {
  userType: 'student' | 'professional' | 'content_creator' | 'author';
  experienceLevel: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  writingGoals: string[];
  preferredTone: 'formal' | 'casual' | 'academic';
}
```

## API Integration

### GPT-4 Integration

The system uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model for:
- Grammar and style analysis
- Writing suggestions
- Content generation
- Writing quality analysis

### Structured Prompts

Each AI function uses carefully crafted prompts to ensure consistent, high-quality responses:

```typescript
// Example grammar analysis prompt
const systemPrompt = `You are an expert grammar, spelling, and style checker. 
Analyze the provided text and identify specific issues with their exact locations.

For each issue found, provide:
- Type: grammar, spelling, or style
- Message: Brief description of the issue
- Position: Character start and end positions
- Suggestions: 1-3 corrected alternatives
- Confidence: How certain you are (0.0-1.0)

Tailor suggestions for a ${userProfile.userType} with ${userProfile.experienceLevel} experience level.`;
```

## Error Handling & Fallbacks

### Graceful Degradation

1. **Missing API Key**: Falls back to demo mode with mock data
2. **API Errors**: Displays user-friendly error messages
3. **Network Issues**: Maintains functionality with cached suggestions
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implements proper debouncing and request management

### Demo Mode

When OpenAI API is unavailable, the system provides:
- Mock grammar errors for common issues
- Sample writing suggestions
- Simulated content generation
- Basic writing statistics

## Performance Optimizations

### Debounced Analysis
- Grammar analysis is debounced to prevent excessive API calls
- Configurable delay (default: 1.5 seconds)
- Smart change detection to avoid redundant analysis

### Caching & State Management
- Dismissed errors are cached to prevent re-detection
- Analysis results are stored until significant text changes
- Efficient re-rendering with React optimizations

### Request Optimization
- Structured response parsing for faster processing
- Token limit management for cost optimization
- Parallel processing where appropriate

## Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Client-side usage only for demo (backend recommended for production)
- Proper error handling to prevent key exposure

### Data Privacy
- Text analysis is sent to OpenAI API
- No persistent storage of user content in AI service
- Compliance with OpenAI's data usage policies
